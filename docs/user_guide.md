## Configuration

Soothe uses two configuration mechanisms: environment variables and a YAML config file.

### Environment Variables

Copy the example and fill in your API keys:

```bash
cp config/env.example .env
```

At minimum, set `OPENAI_API_KEY` (or another LLM provider key):

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

All `SootheConfig` fields can be overridden with `SOOTHE_` prefixed env vars:

```bash
export SOOTHE_DEBUG=true
export SOOTHE_PLANNER_ROUTING=auto
export SOOTHE_CONTEXT_BACKEND=keyword
```

### YAML Config File

For full control, use a YAML config file:

```bash
cp config/config.yml my-config.yml
# Edit my-config.yml
soothe run --config my-config.yml
```

The YAML file supports `${ENV_VAR}` syntax in provider fields such as `api_key` and `api_base_url`:

```yaml
providers:
  - name: openai
    provider_type: openai
    api_base_url: "${OPENAI_BASE_URL}"
    api_key: "${OPENAI_API_KEY}"
```

See [config/config.yml](../config/config.yml) for the complete reference with all fields.

### Model Router

The model router maps purpose-based roles to specific models:

| Role | Purpose | Default |
|------|---------|---------|
| `default` | Orchestrator reasoning | `openai:gpt-4o-mini` |
| `think` | Planning, complex reasoning | Falls back to default |
| `fast` | Classification, scoring | Falls back to default |
| `image` | Vision/image understanding | Falls back to default |
| `embedding` | Vector operations | Falls back to default |
| `web_search` | Web search tasks | Falls back to default |

Configure in YAML:

```yaml
router:
  default: "openai:gpt-4o-mini"
  think: "openai:o3-mini"
  fast: "openai:gpt-4o-mini"
  embedding: "openai:text-embedding-3-small"
```

## Running the Agent

### Interactive TUI Mode

Launch the interactive terminal UI:

```bash
soothe run
```

This opens a Textual-powered TUI with real-time progress, plan visualization, and slash
commands. The TUI shows:

- Subagent activity tracking (running/done status)
- Tool call progress
- Protocol events (context projection, memory recall, plan creation)
- Spinner with phase-aware thinking messages

### Headless Mode

Run a single prompt and exit:

```bash
soothe run "What are the latest developments in quantum computing?"
```

### With Options

```bash
# Use a specific config file
soothe run --config my-config.yml

# Resume a specific thread
soothe run --thread abc123

# Disable TUI (plain streaming output)
soothe run --no-tui

# Increase progress visibility (headless or TUI)
soothe run --progress-verbosity detailed
soothe run --no-tui --progress-verbosity debug "Analyze the project architecture"

# Attach to running daemon with a per-session verbosity override
soothe attach --progress-verbosity detailed
```

Progress verbosity levels:

- `minimal`: assistant text + critical errors only
- `normal` (default): protocol progress events (`soothe.*`) + iteration/goal events
- `detailed`: adds subagent custom events + tool call/result activity
- `debug`: shows all available progress events (including heartbeat/thinking-style events)

Set a default in config:

```yaml
progress_verbosity: normal   # minimal | normal | detailed | debug
```

### Message Surfacing Behavior

Soothe uses a low-noise conversation view and a detailed activity view:

- **ConversationPanel** (TUI): shows user turns and final main-assistant response text.
- **ActivityPanel** (TUI): shows protocol events, tool calls/results, subagent custom events, and subagent text summaries.
- **Headless text mode**: prints main-assistant response text to stdout and progress/activity lines to stderr.
- **Headless JSONL mode**: emits raw stream chunks as JSONL for machine processing.

Verbosity controls what appears in activity/progress surfaces:

- `minimal`: assistant text + errors only
- `normal`: assistant text + protocol events + errors
- `detailed`: adds subagent custom events + tool activity
- `debug`: all categories (including thinking/heartbeat-style events)

Policy checks include profile context in surfaced lines (for example, `allow (profile=standard)`).

### Autonomous Iteration Mode

Soothe supports autonomous multi-iteration execution for complex tasks that require iterative refinement. When enabled, the agent executes a plan, reflects on results, revises the plan, and continues without requiring human input at each step.

#### When to Use Autonomous Mode

Use autonomous mode for tasks that require:
- Iterative refinement based on results (parameter sweeps, optimization)
- Multi-phase research where findings inform next steps
- Long-running workflows where the agent should self-direct
- Decomposition into sub-goals that emerge during execution

#### Command-Line Usage

Enable autonomous mode with the `--autonomous` flag:

```bash
# Autonomous iteration with default settings
soothe run --autonomous "Optimize the simulation parameters across the search space"

# With custom iteration limit
soothe run --autonomous --max-iterations 20 "Research the latest advances in quantum error correction"

# Combine with other flags
soothe run --config my-config.yml --autonomous --progress-verbosity detailed "Analyze and improve model performance"
```

#### How It Works

1. **Goal Creation**: The initial user input creates a primary goal
2. **Plan Generation**: The planner creates a structured plan
3. **Iteration Loop**:
   - Execute the plan (pre-stream → stream → post-stream)
   - Store an iteration record in context
   - Reflect on results (via PlannerProtocol)
   - If revision needed, revise plan and synthesize continuation
   - If goal complete, move to next goal or exit
4. **Self-Driven Goals**: The agent can create new sub-goals during execution using the `manage_goals` tool

#### Goal Lifecycle

Goals have the following lifecycle:
- **Pending**: Created but not yet started
- **Active**: Currently being worked on
- **Completed**: Successfully achieved
- **Failed**: Could not be achieved after retries

The agent can create hierarchical goals (parent/child relationships) and assign priorities. Higher priority goals are executed first.

#### Configuration

Configure autonomous mode in your YAML config:

```yaml
autonomous_max_iterations: 10    # Max iterations per goal
autonomous_max_retries: 2        # Max retries before permanent failure
```

#### Iteration Events

In TUI or detailed verbosity, you'll see:
- `soothe.iteration.started` - Iteration began for a goal
- `soothe.iteration.completed` - Iteration finished with outcome
- `soothe.goal.created` - New goal created
- `soothe.goal.completed` - Goal achieved
- `soothe.goal.failed` - Goal failed (with error and retry count)

#### Reflection and Revision Cycle

After each iteration, the planner reflects on:
- What was accomplished
- What remains to be done
- Whether the current plan is still valid

If revision is needed, the planner updates the plan and a continuation prompt is generated for the next iteration. This enables the agent to adapt its approach based on what it learns.

## TUI Interface

### Slash Commands

Type these in the TUI prompt:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/help` | Show all commands and subagent selector |
| `/plan` | Show current task plan tree |
| `/memory` | Show memory statistics |
| `/context` | Show context statistics |
| `/policy` | Show active policy profile |
| `/thread list` | List all threads |
| `/thread resume <id>` | Resume a specific thread |
| `/thread archive <id>` | Archive a thread |
| `/config` | Show active configuration |
| `/session` | Show session log path |
| `/clear` | Clear screen |
| `/exit` or `/quit` | Exit the TUI |

### Subagent Routing

Prefix your message with a number to route to a specific subagent:

| Prefix | Subagent |
|--------|----------|
| `1` | Main (default) |
| `2` | Planner |
| `3` | Scout |
| `4` | Research |
| `5` | Browser |
| `6` | Claude |
| `7` | Skillify |
| `8` | Weaver |

Examples:

```
4 Search for papers on transformer architectures
5 Open https://example.com and take a screenshot
2 Create a plan for building a REST API
7 Retrieve skills for data processing
8 Generate an agent for PDF extraction
```

Multiple subagents: `4,5 Find and visit the top 3 AI news sites`

### Multi-line Input

End a line with `\` to continue on the next line:

```
soothe> Write a function that \
...  takes a list of numbers \
...  and returns the median
```

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Ctrl+C` once: cancel current task
- `Ctrl+C` twice: exit the TUI

## Subagents

### Research

Deep web research using Tavily search. Automatically breaks queries into sub-searches,
gathers sources, and synthesizes findings.

**Requires**: `pip install soothe[research]` + `TAVILY_API_KEY`

### Planner

Creates structured task plans for complex goals. Decomposes problems into steps with
dependencies. Works with the PlannerProtocol for plan-driven execution.

### Scout

Lightweight exploration agent for quick file searches, code navigation, and codebase
understanding. Uses deepagents' filesystem tools.

### Browser

Automated web browsing via browser-use. Can navigate pages, fill forms, click elements,
and take screenshots.

**Requires**: `pip install soothe[browser]`

Privacy-first defaults: extensions, cloud sync, and telemetry are disabled.

For cleaner CLI/TUI output, raw third-party browser-use stdout/stderr noise is suppressed.
Browser progress still appears through structured subagent activity events (subject to
`progress_verbosity`).

### Claude

Direct access to Claude via the Anthropic SDK. Useful for tasks that benefit from Claude's
strengths (long context, careful reasoning).

**Requires**: `pip install soothe[claude]` + `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`

### Skillify

Skill warehouse and retrieval system. Manages a library of reusable skills (SKILL.md files)
and retrieves relevant skills based on the current task. Helps the agent discover and apply
previously learned patterns and workflows.

**Features**:
- Skill indexing and semantic search
- Skill retrieval based on task context
- Integration with the built_in_skills directory
- Automatic skill discovery from configured paths

**Routing**: Prefix `7` routes to Skillify subagent.

### Weaver

Agent generation and composition system. Dynamically creates specialized agents (subagents)
for specific tasks by composing tools, prompts, and workflows. Enables rapid creation of
task-specific agents without manual coding.

**Features**:
- Generate specialized agents on demand
- Compose tools and prompts into workflows
- Reuse patterns across agent instances
- Integration with Skillify for pattern discovery

**Routing**: Prefix `8` routes to Weaver subagent.

### Enabling/Disabling

In your config YAML:

```yaml
subagents:
  research:
    enabled: true
  browser:
    enabled: true     # enable browser
  claude:
    enabled: false    # keep disabled
```

## Protocols

Soothe's core protocols provide capabilities beyond what deepagents offers.
All protocols are optional and configured via `SootheConfig`.

### Context Protocol

Accumulates knowledge from tool results, subagent outputs, and agent reflections in an
unbounded context ledger. Projects relevant subsets into bounded token windows for LLM
calls and subagent briefings.

```yaml
context_backend: keyword     # keyword (tag matching) | vector (semantic) | none
context_persist_dir: ~/.soothe/context
```

### Memory Protocol

Cross-thread long-term memory. Stores important findings that survive beyond a single
conversation. Retrieved by keyword or semantic relevance at the start of new threads.

```yaml
memory_backend: keyword      # keyword | vector (semantic) | none
memory_persist_path: ~/.soothe/memory/
```

### Planner Protocol

Decomposes complex goals into structured plans with steps, dependencies, and status
tracking. Three tiers:

- **DirectPlanner** -- single LLM structured output call (simple tasks).
- **SubagentPlanner** -- multi-turn planner subagent with filesystem access (medium tasks).
- **ClaudePlanner** -- Claude CLI for deep planning (complex architecture/design tasks).

The `auto` mode uses a hybrid complexity router: heuristic classification first,
then a fast LLM call for ambiguous cases. Routes complex problems to Claude,
medium to SubagentPlanner, and simple to DirectPlanner.

```yaml
planner_routing: auto        # auto | always_direct | always_planner | always_claude
```

### Policy Protocol

Enforces least-privilege delegation. Every tool call and subagent spawn passes through
a policy check. Permissions are structured by category, action, and scope.

```yaml
policy_profile: standard     # named profile (standard, readonly, privileged)
```

### Durability Protocol

Persists and restores agent state. Thread lifecycle management: create, resume, suspend,
archive. Ensures continuity across crashes and restarts.

## Thread Management

### CLI Commands

```bash
# List all threads
soothe thread list

# Archive a thread
soothe thread archive abc123
```

### TUI Commands

```
/thread list
/thread resume abc123
/thread archive abc123
```

### Resuming Threads

```bash
# Resume from CLI
soothe run --thread abc123

# Resume from TUI
/thread resume abc123
```

## MCP Integration

Connect to MCP servers for additional tool capabilities. Configure in YAML using the
Claude Desktop `.mcp.json` format:

```yaml
mcp_servers:
  # Stdio server
  - command: npx
    args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/tmp"]
    transport: stdio

  # HTTP/SSE server
  - url: http://localhost:3000/mcp
    transport: sse
```

MCP sessions are managed alongside thread lifecycle: created on thread start, cleaned
up on suspend/archive.

## Tools

Soothe provides tool groups beyond what deepagents offers. Enable them by name in your config:

```yaml
tools:
  - serper     # Google search (requires SERPER_API_KEY)
  - wizsearch  # Multi-engine web search + crawler (optional TAVILY_API_KEY)
  - jina       # Web reader (requires JINA_API_KEY)
  - image      # Image generation via DALL-E
  - audio      # Audio processing
  - video      # Video processing
  - tabular    # Tabular data analysis
```

Note: deepagents already provides file operations (`ls`, `read_file`, `write_file`,
`edit_file`, `glob`, `grep`), shell execution (`execute`), and task tracking
(`write_todos`). These are always available and do not need to be listed in `tools`.

### Tool Details

**Features**:
- Persistent shell sessions (state maintained between commands)
- Environment variable management
- Working directory tracking
- Timeout handling
- Structured output parsing

#### File Edit Toolkit

File operations with backup and safety features.

**Features**:
- Create, read, edit files with backup copies
- Pattern-based file editing
- Rollback capabilities
- Safety checks before destructive operations

#### Python Executor Toolkit

IPython-based code execution with visualization support.

**Features**:
- Execute Python code in an IPython environment
- Matplotlib integration for plots and visualizations
- Variable persistence across executions
- Output capture and display
- Error handling and debugging support

Useful for data analysis, scientific computing, and rapid prototyping.

#### Document Toolkit

Document processing and extraction.

**Features**:
- Extract text and metadata from various document formats
- Support for PDF, DOCX, TXT, and more
- Structured data extraction
- Document conversion capabilities

#### Goals Tool

Goal lifecycle management for autonomous operation.

**Features**:
- Create new goals during execution
- List and query goal status
- Complete or fail goals programmatically
- Hierarchical goal support (parent/child relationships)
- Priority management

This tool enables the agent to decompose complex tasks into sub-goals dynamically.

## Using Ollama (Local Models)

Soothe supports [Ollama](https://ollama.ai) for running local LLMs without API keys.

### Setup

```bash
pip install soothe[ollama]    # install langchain-ollama
ollama serve                  # start the Ollama server
ollama pull llama3.2          # pull a model
```

### Configuration

```yaml
providers:
  - name: ollama
    provider_type: ollama
    api_base_url: http://localhost:11434
    models:
      - llama3.2
      - qwen3:8b

router:
  default: "ollama:llama3.2"
  fast: "ollama:llama3.2"
```

Ollama uses `provider_type: ollama` (native `ChatOllama` via `langchain-ollama`), **not**
`provider_type: openai`. No API key is required for local models.

## Troubleshooting

### Missing API Key

```
Error: Could not resolve model openai:gpt-4o-mini
```

Set your API key:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

### Model Resolution

The `provider:model` format requires the provider to be defined in `providers`:

```yaml
providers:
  - name: openai
    provider_type: openai
    api_key: "${OPENAI_API_KEY}"

router:
  default: "openai:gpt-4o-mini"   # "openai" must match providers[].name
```

### Browser Subagent Not Working

Install the browser extra:

```bash
pip install soothe[browser]
# or
uv sync --extra browser
```

### Vector Store Connection Errors

Start infrastructure services:

```bash
docker compose up -d   # starts PGVector + Weaviate
```

Configure the connection:

```yaml
vector_store_provider: pgvector
vector_store_config:
  dsn: "postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/vectordb"
```

### Debug Mode

Enable verbose logging:

```bash
export SOOTHE_DEBUG=true
soothe run
```

Or in YAML:

```yaml
debug: true
```
